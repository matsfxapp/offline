# Verifications Are Now A THING!

In the new version of [matSFX](https://alpha.matsfx.com) (Alpha 0.13.3), we’ve added **Verified Users**!  

Here’s how it works:  
- You can get **verified** by being an artist with at least **2 songs** (for now).  
- If you’re part of the **matSFX Design** or **Development Team**, you’ll automatically receive your verified badge within the next **24 hours**!  

**Full Changelog**:
